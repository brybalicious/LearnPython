<b>Setting up Git</b>

Follow instructions online, then after cloning the directory, read the Workflow pdf.

<b>Git Credentials</b>

Use a Credential Helper so you don't have to type your username and password every time you use the command

$ git push

Which one you use depends on your OS. But for the latest version of Git on linux:

For others, start here:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5343068/is-there-a-way-to-skip-password-typing-when-using-https-on-github?noredirect=1&lq=1

Beware - a lot of the credential methods suck. Make sure to use an encrypted method like a keychain.
